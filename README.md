To start the server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`. Not necessary for dev, it is for test tho
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install` inside the `assets` directory
  * Deploy assets with `mix assets.deploy`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
