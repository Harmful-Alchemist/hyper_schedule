# HyperSchedule

Visit a running version [here](https://hyperschedule.online). Start-up time can be a bit slow since the server is spun up on demand. 

To the server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install` inside the `assets` directory
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
